<h1>Description</h1>
<h3>This code simulates a two-wheeled robot with simple kinematics. Its path-following capabilities takes form of a Lyapunov Controller, while its obstacle avoidance algorithm is one I developed myself, called NGAWWI (Node-Generative Angle-Weighted Waypoint Injection).

If you are interested in how it works, you can read the .pdf for an indepth review on how it works.</h3>
